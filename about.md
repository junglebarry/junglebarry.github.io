This is the personal blog of David James Brooks.

I'm the Chief Technology Officer at Whisk.com, a startup based in Birmingham, UK.

I'm a recovering academic, having both a B.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Birmingham][uob]. I specialised in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

I've lived in and around Birmingham for most of my life, and I've worked at a few Birmingham-area startups, including [Untyped][untyped] and [oMbiel][ombiel].

This blog is likely to contain my musings on:

* Functional programming
* Scala
* Natural language processing
* Building software

but I may also ramble on some other matters.
