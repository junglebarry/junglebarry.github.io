This is the personal blog of David James Brooks. The primary audience is me - I write to clarify my thoughts and reflect upon them. If it's of use to others, even better.

I'm the Chief Technology Officer at [Whisk.com][whisk], a startup based in Birmingham, UK.

I'm a recovering academic, having both a B.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Birmingham][uob]. I specialised in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I love learning and helping people to learn.

I've lived in and around Birmingham for most of my life, and I've worked at a few Birmingham-area startups, including [Untyped][untyped] and [oMbiel][ombiel]. 

This blog is likely to contain my musings on:

* Functional programming
* Scala
* Natural language processing
* Building software

but I will also ramble on other matters.
